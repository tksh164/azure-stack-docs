# Install PowerShell AzureRM module for Azure Stack Hub

Azure PowerShell Azure Resource Manager (AzureRM) provides a set of cmdlets that use the Azure Resource Manager model for managing your Azure Stack Hub resources.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You've reached a webpage for an outdated version of Azure Stack Hub PowerShell. All versions of the Azure Resource Manager (AzureRM) PowerShell module are outdated and out of support. AzureRM modules will no longer be updated in future Azure Stack Hub builds. Az modules must be used for builds 2002 and later. The 2020-09-01-hybrid profile is not supported for AzureRM modules.  
> 
> The Az PowerShell module is now the recommended PowerShell module for interacting with Azure and Azure Stack Hub. To get started with the Az PowerShell module, see [Install PowerShell Az preview module for Azure Stack Hub](powershell-install-az-module.md). To learn how to migrate to the Az PowerShell module. see [Migrate from AzureRM to Azure PowerShell Az in Azure Stack Hub](migrate-azurerm-az.md). For details on the increased functionality of the Az modules, which have been adopted across global Azure, see [Introducing the Azure Az PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az).


You also need to use *API profiles* to specify the compatible endpoints for the Azure Stack Hub resource providers.

API profiles provide a way to manage version differences between Azure and Azure Stack Hub. An API version profile is a set of Azure Resource Manager PowerShell modules with specific API versions. Each cloud platform has a set of supported API version profiles. For example, Azure Stack Hub supports a specific profile version such as **2019-03-01-hybrid**. When you install a profile, the Azure Resource Manager PowerShell modules that correspond to the specified profile are installed.

You can install Azure Stack Hub compatible PowerShell modules in internet-connected, partially connected, or disconnected scenarios. This article walks you through the detailed instructions for these scenarios.

You can also run the Azure Resource Manager modules for Azure Stack Hub in a Docker container. For instructions, see [Use Docker to run PowerShell for Azure Stack Hub](../user/azure-stack-powershell-user-docker.md).

## 1. Verify your prerequisites

Before you get started with Azure Stack Hub and the PowerShell Azure Resource Manager module, you must have the following prerequisites:

- **PowerShell Version 5.1** <br>
To check your version, run **$PSVersionTable.PSVersion** and compare the **Major** version. If you don't have PowerShell 5.1, follow the [Installing Windows PowerShell](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-windows-powershell#upgrading-existing-windows-powershell).

  > [!Note]
  > PowerShell 5.1 requires a Windows machine.

- **Run PowerShell in an elevated command prompt**.

- **PowerShell Gallery access** <br>
  You need access to the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com). The gallery is the central repository for PowerShell content. The **PowerShellGet** module contains cmdlets for discovering, installing, updating, and publishing PowerShell artifacts. Examples of these artifacts are modules, DSC resources, role capabilities, and scripts from the PowerShell Gallery and other private repositories. If you're using PowerShell in a disconnected scenario, you must retrieve resources from a machine with a connection to the internet and store them in a location accessible to your disconnected machine.

## 2. Validate the PowerShell Gallery accessibility

Validate if PSGallery is registered as a repository.

> [!Note]  
> This step requires internet access.

Open an elevated PowerShell prompt, and run the following cmdlets:

```powershell
Install-module -Name PowerShellGet -Force
Import-Module -Name PackageManagement -ErrorAction Stop
Get-PSRepository -Name "PSGallery"
```

If the repository isn't registered, open an elevated PowerShell session and run the following command:

```powershell
Register-PSRepository -Default
Set-PSRepository -Name "PSGallery" -InstallationPolicy Trusted
```

## 3. Uninstall existing versions of the Azure Stack Hub PowerShell modules

Before installing the required version, make sure that you uninstall any previously installed Azure Stack Hub Azure Resource Manager PowerShell modules. Uninstall the modules by using one of the following two methods:

1. To uninstall the existing Azure Resource Manager and Az PowerShell modules, close all the active PowerShell sessions, and run the following cmdlets:

    ```powershell
    Get-Module -Name Azure* -ListAvailable | Uninstall-Module -Force -Verbose -ErrorAction Continue
    Get-Module -Name Azs.* -ListAvailable | Uninstall-Module -Force -Verbose -ErrorAction Continue
    Get-Module -Name Az.* -ListAvailable | Uninstall-Module -Force -Verbose -ErrorAction Continue
    ```

    If you hit an error such as 'The module is already in use', close the PowerShell sessions that are using the modules and rerun the above script.

2. Delete all the folders that start with `Azure`, `Az` or `Azs.` from the `C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules` and `C:\Users\{yourusername}\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules` folders. Deleting these folders removes any existing PowerShell modules.

## 4. Connected: Install PowerShell for Azure Stack Hub with internet connectivity

The API version profile and Azure Stack Hub PowerShell modules you require will depend on the version of Azure Stack Hub you're running.

### Install Azure Stack Hub PowerShell

Run the following PowerShell script to install these modules on your development workstation:

::: moniker range=">=azs-2002"
For Azure Stack Hub 2002 or later:

You can use either user AzureRm modules or Az preview modules. The use of the Az modules requires Azure Stack Hub 2002 or later.

To use Az preview modules, follow the instructions at [Install PowerShell Az module](powershell-install-az-module.md).

```powershell  
# Install the AzureRM.BootStrapper module. Select Yes when prompted to install NuGet
Install-Module -Name AzureRM.BootStrapper

# Install and import the API Version Profile required by Azure Stack Hub into the current PowerShell session.
Use-AzureRmProfile -Profile 2019-03-01-hybrid -Force
Install-Module -Name AzureStack -RequiredVersion 1.8.3 
```

::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="azs-1910"
For Azure Stack Hub 1910:

```powershell  
# Install the AzureRM.BootStrapper module. Select Yes when prompted to install NuGet
Install-Module -Name AzureRM.BootStrapper

# Install and import the API Version Profile required by Azure Stack Hub into the current PowerShell session.
Use-AzureRmProfile -Profile 2019-03-01-hybrid -Force
Install-Module -Name AzureStack -RequiredVersion 1.8.0
```

> [!Note]  
> - Azure Stack Hub module version 1.8.0 is a breaking change release. Refer to the [release note](release-notes.md) for details.

::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="<=azs-1908"
For Azure Stack Hub 1908 or earlier:

```powershell  
# Install the AzureRM.BootStrapper module. Select Yes when prompted to install NuGet
Install-Module -Name AzureRM.BootStrapper

# Install and import the API Version Profile required by Azure Stack Hub into the current PowerShell session.
Use-AzureRmProfile -Profile 2019-03-01-hybrid -Force
Install-Module -Name AzureStack -RequiredVersion 1.7.2
```

> [!Note]  
> The Azure Stack Hub module version 1.7.2 is a breaking change release. To migrate from Azure Stack Hub 1.6.0, please refer to the [migration guide](https://aka.ms/azspshmigration171).

::: moniker-end

### Confirm the installation of PowerShell

Confirm the installation by running the following command:

```powershell
Get-Module -Name "Azure*" -ListAvailable
Get-Module -Name "Azs*" -ListAvailable
```

If the installation is successful, the `AzureRm` and `AzureStack` modules are displayed in the output.

## 5. Disconnected: Install PowerShell without an internet connection

In a disconnected scenario, you first download the PowerShell modules to a machine that has internet connectivity. Then, you transfer them to the Azure Stack Development Kit (ASDK) for installation.

Sign in to a computer with internet connectivity and use the following scripts to download the Azure Resource Manager and Azure Stack Hub packages, depending on your version of Azure Stack Hub.

Installation has five steps:

1. Install Azure Stack Hub PowerShell to a connected machine.
2. Enable additional storage features.
3. Transport the PowerShell packages to your disconnected workstation.
4. Manually bootstrap the NuGet provider on your disconnected workstation.
5. Confirm the installation of PowerShell.

### Install Azure Stack Hub PowerShell

::: moniker range=">=azs-2002"
Azure Stack Hub 2002 or later.

You could either use Azure Resource Manager or Az preview modules. For Az modules, see instructions at [Install PowerShell Az module](powershell-install-az-module.md).

```powershell

Install-module -Name PowerShellGet -Force 
Import-Module -Name PackageManagement -ErrorAction Stop

$Path = "<Path that is used to save the packages>"
Save-Package -ProviderName NuGet -Source https://www.powershellgallery.com/api/v2 -Name AzureRM -Path $Path -Force -RequiredVersion 2.5.0
Save-Package -ProviderName NuGet -Source https://www.powershellgallery.com/api/v2 -Name AzureStack -Path $Path -Force -RequiredVersion 1.8.3

> The Azure Stack Hub module version 1.7.1 is a breaking change. To migrate from Azure Stack Hub 1.6.0 please refer to the [migration guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell/tree/AzureRM/documentation/migration-guides/Stack).

::: moniker-end

> [!NOTE]  
> On machines without an internet connection, we recommend executing the following cmdlet for disabling the telemetry data collection. You may experience a performance degradation of the cmdlets without disabling the telemetry data collection. This is applicable only for the machines without internet connections
> ```powershell
> Disable-AzureRmDataCollection
> ```

### Add your packages to your workstation

1. Copy the downloaded packages to a USB device.

2. Sign in to the disconnected workstation and copy the packages from the USB device to a location on the workstation.

3. Manually bootstrap the NuGet provider on your disconnected workstation. For instructions, see [Manually bootstrapping the NuGet provider on a machine that isn't connected to the internet](/powershell/scripting/gallery/how-to/getting-support/bootstrapping-nuget#manually-bootstrapping-the-nuget-provider-on-a-machine-that-is-not-connected-to-the-internet).

4. Register this location as the default repository and install the Azure Resource Manager and `AzureStack` modules from this repository:

   ```powershell
   # requires -Version 5
   # requires -RunAsAdministrator
   # requires -Module PowerShellGet
   # requires -Module PackageManagement

   $SourceLocation = "<Location on the development kit that contains the PowerShell packages>"
   $RepoName = "MyNuGetSource"

   Register-PSRepository -Name $RepoName -SourceLocation $SourceLocation -InstallationPolicy Trusted

   Install-Module -Name AzureRM -Repository $RepoName

   Install-Module -Name AzureStack -Repository $RepoName
   ```

### Confirm the installation of PowerShell

Confirm the installation by running the following command:

```powershell
Get-Module -Name "Azure*" -ListAvailable
Get-Module -Name "Azs*" -ListAvailable
```

## 6. Configure PowerShell to use a proxy server

In scenarios that require a proxy server to access the internet, you first configure PowerShell to use an existing proxy server:

1. Open an elevated PowerShell prompt.
2. Run the following commands:

   ```powershell
   #To use Windows credentials for proxy authentication
   [System.Net.WebRequest]::DefaultWebProxy.Credentials = [System.Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultCredentials

   #Alternatively, to prompt for separate credentials that can be used for #proxy authentication
   [System.Net.WebRequest]::DefaultWebProxy.Credentials = Get-Credential
   ```

## Known issue

###  Method get_SerializationSettings error 

- Cause: The PowerShell Az module and PowerShell Azure Resource Manager modules are not compatible.

    The following error indicates that the Azure Resource Manager modules and Az modules are loaded in the same session: 

    ```powershell  
    >  Method 'get_SerializationSettings' in type 'Microsoft.Azure.Management.Internal.Resources.ResourceManagementClient' from assembly 'Microsoft.Azure.Commands.ResourceManager.Common, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35' does 
    not have an implementation.
    ```

- Remediation: Uninstall the conflicting modules. 

  If you would like to use the Azure Resource Manager modules, uninstall the Az modules. Or uninstall the Azure Resource Manager if you would like to use the Az modules. Close your PowerShell session and uninstall either the Az or Azure Resource Manager modules.
