# Azure Stack Hub hotfix 1.2206.2.38

## Summary

- Fixed an issue in the Virtual Machine Scale Set portal creation experience that caused the addition of an existing load balancer to fail.
- Removed unsupported **Reapply** feature in the virtual machine portal experience.
- Fixed an issue in which the infrastructure backup information displayed on the portal is not consistent with the alert.
- Improved blob metadata backup stability by skipping unnecessary dependency.
- Optimized reading of disk IOPS values to support VMs with a large number of data disks.
