# Common deployments for Azure Stack Hub

Azure Stack Hub supports both infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS). This article lists resources for setting up a virtual machine (VM) and then deploying it to Azure Stack Hub.

## Before you begin

Before you begin to deploy an app to Azure Stack Hub, set up your development machine. For instructions on getting ready to work with Azure Stack Hub as a developer, see [Set up a development environment in Azure Stack Hub](azure-stack-dev-start.md).

## Deploy an app to a VM

In the following how-to articles, you set up a virtual machine (VM) in Azure Stack Hub and then deploy your app from your development workstation to Azure Stack Hub.

- [.NET Core (C#)](azure-stack-dev-start-howto-vm-dotnet.yml)
- [Java](azure-stack-dev-start-howto-vm-java.md)
- [Go](azure-stack-dev-start-howto-vm-go.md)
- [Ruby](azure-stack-dev-start-howto-vm-ruby.md)
- [Python](azure-stack-dev-start-howto-vm-python.md)
- [NodeJS](azure-stack-dev-start-howto-vm-nodejs.md)

## Next steps
