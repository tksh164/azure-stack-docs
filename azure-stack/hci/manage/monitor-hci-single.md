# Configure Azure portal to monitor Azure Stack HCI clusters (preview)

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../../includes/hci-applies-to-22h2-21h2.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The functionality described in this article requires the latest Azure Stack HCI update. Previous versions of Azure Stack HCI display a **Monitoring** tile instead of an **Insights** tile, and the **Insights** menu is not available. Please [install the latest update](update-cluster.md) to get the new capabilities.

This article explains how to enable Azure Insights capabilities to monitor an Azure Stack HCI cluster with Azure Stack HCI Insights.

If you haven't already, be sure to [Register your cluster with Azure](../deploy/register-with-azure.md). After you've enabled logs and monitoring, you can use [Azure Stack HCI Insights](/azure-stack/hci/manage/monitor-hci-multi) to monitor cluster health, performance, and usage. Monitoring an Azure Stack HCI cluster from Azure portal requires every server in the cluster to be Azure Arc-enabled. If you registered your cluster on or after June 15, 2021, this happens by default. Otherwise, you'll need to [enable Azure Arc integration](../deploy/register-with-azure.md#enable-azure-arc-integration).

## Logs capability (preview)

After you register your cluster and Arc-enable the servers, you'll see the following in Azure portal:

- An Azure Stack HCI resource in the specified resource group.
- **Server - Azure Arc** resources for every server in the cluster in the `<clustername>ArcInstanceResourceGroup`.
- Nodes with a **Server-Azure Arc** resource link on the Azure Stack HCI resource page under the **Nodes** tab.

Now that your cluster nodes are Arc-enabled, navigate to your Azure Stack HCI cluster resource page. Under the **Capabilities** tab you will see the option to enable logs, which should say **Not configured**.

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/logs-capability.png" alt-text="Logs capability under the Capabilities tab" lightbox="media/monitor-azure-portal/logs-capability.png":::

This capability is an Arc for Servers extension that simplifies installing the Microsoft Monitoring Agent. Because you're using the Arc for Servers extension to enable this workflow, if you ever add additional servers to your cluster, they will automatically have the Microsoft Monitoring Agent installed on them.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The Microsoft Monitoring Agent for Windows communicates outbound to the Azure Monitor service over TCP port 443. If the servers connect through a firewall or proxy server to communicate over the internet, review [these requirements](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/log-analytics-agent#network-requirements) to understand the network configuration required.

### Configure the Log Analytics Agent extension

To configure the Log Analytics Agent extension:

1. Under the **Capabilities** tab, select **Logs**.
2. Select **Use existing** to use the existing workspace for your subscription.
3. Select **Add** at the bottom of the page.

   :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/enable-log-analytics.png" alt-text="Enable Log Analytics on Azure portal" lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/enable-log-analytics.png":::

4. When the configuration is finished, **Logs** will appear as **Configured** under the **Capabilities** tab.
5. Select **Settings > Extensions** from the toolbar on the left. You should see that each of your servers has successfully installed the Microsoft Monitoring Agent.

You have now successfully installed the log analytics extension.

### Disable Log Analytics

If you'd like to disable the Logs capability, you'll need to remove the Microsoft Monitoring Agent from the **Extensions** settings. Note that this does not delete the Log Analytics workspace in Azure or any of the data that resides in it, so you'll have to do that manually.

To remove the Microsoft Monitoring Agent from every server in the cluster, follow these steps:

1. Select **Settings > Extensions** from the toolbar on the left.
2. Select the **MicrosoftMonitoringAgent** checkbox.
3. Click **Remove**, and then **Yes**.

## Insights capability (preview)

Insights was previously known as "monitoring" and is used to monitor your resources and provide useful insights regarding cluster, servers, virtual machines, storage, and much more.

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/cluster-preview.png" alt-text="Cluster portal screen" lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/cluster-preview.png":::

The data generated from your on-premises Azure Stack HCI cluster is collected in a Log Analytics workspace in Azure. Within that workspace, you can collect data about the health of your cluster. By default, monitoring collects the following logs every hour:

- Health Management (Microsoft-windows-health/operational)
- SDDC Management (Microsoft-Windows-SDDC-Management/Operational; Event ID: 3000, 3001, 3002, 3003, 3004)

To change the frequency of log collection, see [Event Log Channel](/azure-stack/hci/manage/monitor-hci-multi#event-log-channel).

## Enable Insights

Enabling Insights helps you monitor all Azure Stack HCI clusters currently associated with the Log Analytics workspace by providing useful health metrics. To enable this capability from the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. Under the **Capabilities** tab, select **Insights**. Then select **Turn on**.
2. Insights should now show as **Configured** in the **Capabilities** tab.

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/enable-insights.png" alt-text="Portal screen to enable Insights" lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/enable-insights.png":::

The **Microsoft-windows-sddc-management/operational** and **microsoft-windows-health/operational** Windows event channel will be
added to your Log Analytics workspace under **Windows event logs**.

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/windows-event-logs.png" alt-text="Portal workspace for Windows event logs" lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/windows-event-logs.png":::

By collecting these logs, analytics will show the health status of the individual servers, drives, volumes, and VMs. By default, 5 performance counters will be added:

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/performance-counters.png" alt-text="Windows performance counters" lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/performance-counters.png":::

### Performance counters

The following table describes the performance counters that are monitored:

| Performance counters                          | Description                                                                                                                                                           |

## Azure Monitor pricing

As described previously, when you enable monitoring visualization, logs are collected from:

- Health Management (Microsoft-windows-health/operational).
- SDDC Management (Microsoft-Windows-SDDC-Management/Operational; Event ID: 3000, 3001, 3002, 3003, 3004).

You are billed based on the amount of data ingested and the data retention settings of your Log Analytics workspace.

Azure Monitor has pay-as-you-go pricing, and the first 5 GB per billing account per month is free. Because pricing can vary due to multiple factors, such as the region of Azure you're using, visit the [Azure Monitor pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/) for the most up-to-date pricing calculations. The following table can help you calculate the cost:

| Clusters in standalone Log Analytics workspace | GB ingested per month |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Two-node cluster                               | \~1 MB per hour       |
| Four-node cluster                              | \~1 MB per hour       |
| Eight-node cluster                             | \~1 MB per hour       |

The following table shows the pricing structure for Azure Stack HCI clusters of different sizes:

| Clusters in same Log Analytics workspace | GB ingested per month |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Small deployment (3 two-node clusters)       | \~3 GB                    |
| Medium deployment (10 four-node clusters)    | \~10 GB                   |
| Large deployment (25 four-node clusters)     | \~25 GB                   |

## Troubleshooting

If the Logs capability and Monitoring capability are enabled without errors but the monitoring data doesn't appear after an hour or so, you can use the [Log Analytics Troubleshooting Tool](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agent-windows-troubleshoot).

### How to use the Log Analytics Troubleshooting Tool

1. Open a PowerShell prompt as Administrator on the Azure Stack HCI host where Log Analytics Agent is installed.
2. Navigate to the directory where the tool is located.

   ```PowerShell
   cd C:\Program Files\Microsoft Monitoring Agent\Agent\Troubleshooter
   ```

3. Execute the main script using this command:

   ```PowerShell
   .\GetAgentInfo.ps1
   ```

4. When prompted to select a troubleshooting scenario, choose option 1: **Agent not reporting data or heartbeat data missing**.

5. You'll be prompted to select the action that you'd like to perform. Choose option **1: Diagnose**.

6. If you encounter the error that's highlighted in the following screenshot but are still able to connect to all Log Analytics endpoints and your firewall and gateway settings are correct, you have likely encountered a timezone issue.

   :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/tool-errors.png" alt-text="Command prompt showing tool errors" lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/tool-errors.png":::

   The cause is that the local time is different than Azure time, and the workspace key could not be validated due to the mismatch.

7. To resolve the issue:

   1. Go to your Azure Stack HCI resource page in Azure portal, select **[cluster name] > Extensions**. Then select the tick box for MicrosoftMonitoringAgent and remove the Microsoft Monitoring Agent Extension.
   1. Ensure that your Azure Stack HCI host time zone is correct, and that the local time on the host is the same as Azure time for your time zone.
      1. From the Azure Stack HCI host console, select **option 9: Date & Time** from the **Sconfig** menu, then select **change time zone** and ensure local time is correct.
      1. Review the Active Directory PDC (Primary Domain Controller) time zone, and make sure the date and time are correct.
      1. If Active Directory PDC is correct and Azure Stack HCI local time is still incorrect, then the Active Directory domain hierarchy is not being recognized. If this is the case, complete steps iv - vi below. Otherwise, proceed to step c.
      1. From the Azure Stack HCI host,  select **option 15** to exit the **Sconfig menu**. Then run the following command in PowerShell as an administrator: `w32tm.exe /config /syncfromflags:domhier /update` - this should return a confirmation that the command completed successfully, and the time setting should now be correct.
      1. To diagnose further, run `w32tm /monitor` on the Azure Stack HCI host console. The active domain controller should be listed as stratum 1 server, and all other domain controllers as stratum 2.
      1. Lastly, ensure that the Windows time service and time providers are not configured in a Group Policy Object, as this will interfere with the Active Directory domain hierarchy.
   1. Re-add the **Log Analytics** extension by going to your Azure Stack HCI resource page in Azure portal, select **[cluster name] > Overview**, then select **Capabilities** and configure Log Analytics and Monitoring.

8. Rerun the Log Analytics Troubleshooting Tool and you should no longer see the error. You should now see Windows agent numbers increment in your Log Analytics workspace under **Agents Management** to match your cluster nodes, and monitoring events will begin to flow.
