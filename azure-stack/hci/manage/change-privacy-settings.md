# Change privacy settings on individual servers

> Applies to: Azure Stack HCI, versions 22H2 and 21H2; Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016

Hereâ€™s how to change the privacy settings on a server running either the Azure Stack HCI operating system or Windows Server. To manage privacy settings with Group Policy on either multiple servers at once or in your enterprise as a whole, see [Manage enterprise diagnostic data](/windows/privacy/configure-windows-diagnostic-data-in-your-organization#manage-enterprise-diagnostic-data).

## Azure Stack HCI or Server Core
If the server uses either the Azure Stack HCI operating system or Windows Server with the Server Core installation option, use the following steps:
1. Connect to a server in the Azure Stack HCI cluster by using Remote Desktop, a remote management (headless or BMC) controller, with a KVM, or by signing on locally by using a keyboard and monitor. 
1. If you connect to a server running Azure Stack HCI, the Server Configuration tool (Sconfig) opens automatically. If you connect to a server running Windows Server with Server Core, at the command prompt, enter `Sconfig`.
1. At the **Enter a number to select an option:** prompt, type **10** and press Enter.
1. On the **Change Telemetry** confirmation prompt, select **Yes** to display the following options:

    Available Telemetry settings: **1 Security**, **2 Basic**, **3 Enhanced**, **4 Full**

    >[!NOTE]
    > The default setting for Azure Stack HCI is **1 Security**.

1. At the **Enter new telemetry setting:** prompt, type the option you want and press Enter.

## Full Desktop
If the server is running Windows Server and has the Full Desktop installation option, use the following steps:
1. Connect to the Server Manager Dashboard of the Windows Server.

    You can connect locally by using a keyboard and monitor, or using a remote management (headless or BMC) controller, or Remote Desktop. 

1. In Server Manage under **Dashboard**, select **Local Server**.
1. On the **Properties** page of the server, next to **Feedback & Diagnostics**, select **Settings**.

    On the **Setting** page, the **Feedback frequency** and **Diagnostic and usage data** settings display. 
 
1. Expand the **Diagnostic and usage data** setting to select one of the following options:
    - **Required diagnostic data**
    - **Enhanced**
    - **Optional diagnostic data**

    >[!NOTE]
    > On the **Settings** page, if the notice **Some settings are managed by your organization** displays, then the **Diagnotic and usage data** setting may not be available.
