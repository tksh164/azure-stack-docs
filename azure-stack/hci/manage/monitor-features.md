# Monitor Azure Stack HCI features with Insights

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../../includes/hci-applies-to-23h2.md)]

This article describes how to use Insights to monitor key Azure Stack HCI features, such as Resilient File System (ReFS) deduplication and compression.

To monitor Azure Stack HCI clusters with Insights, see [Monitor a single Azure Stack HCI cluster with Insights](./monitor-hci-single-23h2.md) and [Monitor multiple Azure Stack HCI clusters with Insights](./monitor-hci-multi-23h2.md).

## About using Insights to monitor features

Insights for Azure Stack HCI collects logs for different Azure Stack HCI features, which are processed using Kusto Query Language (KQL), and then visualized using the [Azure workbooks](/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview).

Enabling Insights on your Azure Stack HCI cluster provides access to a set of sample workbooks that you can use as-is or as a starting point to create custom workbooks. These workbooks help visualize the collected data and gain insights into the key Azure Stack HCI features, including:

- **ReFS deduplication and compression.** Monitor and analyze savings, performance impact, and jobs related to the ReFS deduplication and compression feature. See [Monitor ReFS deduplication and compression](#monitor-refs-deduplication-and-compression).

## Prerequisites

You must complete the following prerequisites before you can use Insights for monitoring Azure Stack HCI features:

- You must have access to an Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2 cluster deployed, registered, and connected to Azure.

- Your cluster must be Arc-enabled and have [Azure Monitor extension installed](./arc-extension-management.md#install-an-extension).

- You must have [Insights enabled on the cluster](./monitor-hci-single-23h2.md#enable-insights).

## Monitor features with Insights

Follow these steps to monitor Azure Stack HCI features with Insights:

1. Make sure all the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) are met.

1. In the Azure portal, browse to your Azure Stack HCI cluster resource page, and then select your cluster.

1. Select **Insights** from the left pane, and then select the **Overview** tab.

    This tab provides a list of Azure Stack HCI features available for monitoring, along with descriptions of what is monitored, and the current monitoring status.

    :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-features/overview-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Overview tab." lightbox="media/monitor-features/overview-tab.png":::

    The following table describes the different monitoring statuses:

    | Monitoring status | Description |
    |--|--|
    | Enabled | Indicates that monitoring is enabled for the feature. Insights collects log data from Windows events and performance counters related to the feature. |
    | Not enabled | Indicates that monitoring is disabled for the feature, preventing data collection and insights. This is the default status. |
    | Needs update | Indicates that there are some configuration issues that prevent Insights from collecting data. This can happen when the required events or data sources aren't correctly configured within the workbook. You must update Insights for the feature to successfully collect data. |

Based on the monitoring status, you can perform one of these actions:

- Enable monitoring for a feature. See [Enable monitoring for a feature](#enable-monitoring-for-a-feature).

- Disable monitoring for a feature. See [Disable monitoring for a feature](#disable-monitoring-for-a-feature).

- Enable or disable monitoring for multiple features. See [Enable or disable monitoring for multiple features](#enable-or-disable-monitoring-for-multiple-features).

- Update monitoring for a feature. See [Update monitoring for a feature](#update-monitoring-for-a-feature).

### Enable monitoring for a feature

By default, monitoring for a feature isn't enabled and the monitoring status is displayed as **Not enabled**.

When you enable monitoring for a feature, Insights automatically adds the necessary performance counters and Windows event logs to the associated data collection rule (DCR) within the cluster. Once the DCR is configured, you receive a success message, and the feature name changes from plain text to a clickable link on the **Overview** tab.

Once you enable monitoring, it takes around 20-30 minutes for Insights to start collecting data and provide health, performance, and usage insights.

Follow these steps to enable monitoring for a feature:

1. On the **Overview** tab, select the feature with the **Not enabled** monitoring status.

    :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-features/feature-not-enabled.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the status of ReFS deduplication and compression as not enabled." lightbox="media/monitor-features/feature-not-enabled.png":::

1. A context pane opens on the right that provides more details, such as a sample image of the workbook. Select the **Enable** button.

    :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-features/enable-feature-monitoring.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Enable button to enable monitoring of the ReFS deduplication and compression feature." lightbox="media/monitor-features/enable-feature-monitoring.png":::

1. After you enable monitoring for a feature, the monitoring status for that feature changes from **Not enabled** to **Enabled** and its name changes from plain text to a clickable link. You can select the feature name to open its workbook.

### Disable monitoring for a feature

By disabling monitoring for a feature, Insights stops collecting monitoring data associated with that feature. However, this action doesn't affect other event collection on this DCR or previously collected data.

Follow these steps to disable monitoring for a feature:

1. On the **Overview** tab, select the feature with the **Enabled** monitoring status.

1. On the **Disable selected insights** pane on the right, select the **Disable** button.

    :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-features/disable-feature-monitoring.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Disable button to disable monitoring of the ReFS deduplication and compression feature." lightbox="media/monitor-features/disable-feature-monitoring.png":::

### Enable or disable monitoring for multiple features

Follow these steps to enable or disable monitoring for multiple features simultaneously from the **Overview** tab.

1. On the **Overview** tab, select the checkboxes next to the desired features.

1. Select either **Enable selected** or **Disable selected**. The **Enable selected insights** or **Disable selected insights** pane appears on the right. It displays a list of features that you selected to enable monitoring or disable monitoring.

1. Select either the **Enable** or **Disable** button to enable or disable monitoring for all the selected features at once.

### Update monitoring for a feature

On the **Overview** tab, if **Monitoring status** of a feature is displayed as **Needs update**, it indicates that there are some configuration issues preventing Insights to collect data.

Follow these steps to update Insights:

1. On the **Overview** tab, select the **Needs update** link for the feature with the **Needs update** monitoring status.

1. On the right pane, select the **Needs update** button to install the required configuration updates for Insights.
