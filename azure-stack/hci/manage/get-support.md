# Get support for Azure Stack HCI

[!INCLUDE [hci-applies-to-23h2-22h2](../../includes/hci-applies-to-23h2-22h2.md)]

This topic provides guidance on how to get support for the Azure Stack HCI operating system. Azure Stack HCI follows the same support process as Azure. Enterprise customers can follow the process described in [Create an Azure support request](/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request). If you're a customer of a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), contact your CSP for support.

To create an Azure Stack HCI support request requires one of the following Azure support plans: Standard, Professional Direct, or Developer. You cannot use the Basic plan.

For more information, see:

- [Compare support plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/)
- [Azure Support Plans FAQs](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/faq/)

Get remote support by allowing Microsoft support to access your device remotely and perform limited troubleshooting and repair. For information about how to get remote support, see [Get remote support](get-remote-support.md).
