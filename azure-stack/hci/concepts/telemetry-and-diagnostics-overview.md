# Azure Stack HCI telemetry and diagnostics extension overview (preview)

>Applies to: Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2 (preview)

This article provides a brief overview, benefits, and the options for the telemetry and diagnostics extension used for your Azure Stack HCI cluster.

## About the extension

Previously, Azure Stack HCI used the operating system to report telemetry data to Microsoft. Now, the telemetry and diagnostics extension configures and manages the telemetry data. For more information, see
[Azure Arc extension management on Azure Stack HCI](../manage/arc-extension-management.md#azure-managed-extensions-in-azure-stack-hci-preview).

## Benefits

Emitted system data can be installed and managed through the telemetry and diagnostics extension, which offers several benefits. Some of the advantages of the telemetry and diagnostics extension include:

- **Improved transparency:** Supplies the Azure portal with the extension name, version, and status.

- **Resource consumption controls:** Ensures that no more than 5% CPU is consumed. Control of the process is enforced via the Azure Arc extension framework.

- **Reduced update impact:** Updates can be made without disrupting the system and don't require a reboot of the host server.

  - When available you can seamlessly update the environment with new or improved functionality.

- **Improved compliance:** Enables the telemetry and diagnostics data to comply with regional service and data residency requirements during data uploads.
  
- **Simplified log gathering:** When the collection functionality is readily available, it's easier to collect diagnostics logs. With proactive log collection enabled, Microsoft can proactively collect logs and search for specific errors or exception patterns, which saves support time.

- **Faster case resolution**: Your Azure Stack HCI system logs can help Microsoft customer support and engineering teams identify and resolve your issues quickly and efficiently.

## Telemetry and diagnostics settings

You maintain control over whether you send telemetry data to Microsoft, even after you've installed and run the telemetry extension. To access the options to send telemetry data, navigate to your cluster **Settings** in the Azure portal and select **Extensions**.

You can choose one of these options for sharing telemetry data:

- **Off:** You don't send system data to Microsoft.

- **Basic:** You send Microsoft the minimum system data required to keep clusters current, secure, and operating properly.

- **Enhanced:** You send more system data to help Microsoft identify and fix operational issues and for product improvements. We strongly recommend that you enable **enhanced diagnostics**. Some of the benefits of enhanced telemetry data sharing include:

  - Retain system data for up to a month.
  - Automatically capture errors and diagnostics information for speedier issue resolution. No operator interaction is required.
  - Proactively collect and upload logs to an Azure Storage account for troubleshooting.

If there's no or intermittent connectivity, Microsoft captures and store logs locally for failure analysis by customer support. Logs aren't sent to Azure.

## Data collection consent

Microsoft collects data in accordance with its [standard privacy practices](https://privacy.microsoft.com/). The new telemetry agent doesn't override your existing control setting.

If you withdraw your consent for data collection, any data collected before withdrawal isn't affected. Microsoft continues to handle and use the data collected in accordance with the terms that were in place at the time of the data collection.

Here are a couple of things to consider with data collection:

- Understand how Microsoft handles and uses your data. Review Microsoft's privacy practices and policies.

- Understand the implications of consenting to data collection and the withdrawal of consent. Consult with legal or privacy professionals to ensure complete understanding.

### Azure Stack HCI privacy considerations

Azure Stack HCI routes system data back to a protected cloud storage location. Only Microsoft personnel with a valid business need are given access to the system data. Microsoft doesn't share personal customer data with third parties, except at the customer's discretion or for the limited purposes described in the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement). Data sharing decisions are made by an internal Microsoft team including privacy, legal, and data management stakeholders.

Don't include any confidential information or personal information in resource or file names. For example, VM names, volume names, configuration file names, storage file names (VHD names), or cluster resource names.

## Error handling

We have identified and provided unique error codes with expected messages to handle errors in extensions.
Here are some examples:

| Error code | Error message | Description | Mitigation steps |
|------------|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| 9 | There's insufficient disk space available on the drive. To proceed with the extension installation, delete some files to free up space. | The extension validates as a pre-installation step and requires a minimum of 20 GB of space for the GMA cache on the SystemDrive. If the drive doesn't have enough space, the extension raises an error message for this issue. | Free up the disk space to allow the extension to continue.|
| 12 | The extension can't create the tenant JSON configuration files if either the `Get-AzureStackHCI` or `Get-ClusterNode` cmdlet isn't available to retrieve the necessary information. | The extension uses the `Get-AzureStackHCI` and `Get-ClusterNode` cmdlets to identify parameters and retrieve information needed to create the tenant JSONs. If these cmdlets aren't present, the extension raises an error message with an indication that it can't proceed without them. | Complete the Azure Stack HCI registration step correctly. |
| 1 | An unhandled exception has occurred. | If an unhandled exception occurs, an error message is displayed. You can find the complete error message and its stack trace in the Extension logs. | Check the generic error message and contact Microsoft Support. Follow this path `C:\ProgramData\GuestConfig\extension_logs\Microsoft.AzureStack.Observability.TelemetrAndDiagnostics\ObservabilityExtension.log` to the logs and provide them to Microsoft Support.|
