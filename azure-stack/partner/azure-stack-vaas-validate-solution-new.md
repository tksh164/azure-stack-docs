# Validate a solution in Azure Stack Hub

[!INCLUDE [Azure_Stack_Partner](./includes/azure-stack-partner-appliesto.md)]

Learn how to use the **solution validation** workflow to validate new Azure Stack Hub solutions.

An Azure Stack Hub solution is a hardware bill of materials (BoM) that has been jointly agreed upon between Microsoft and the partner after meeting the Windows Server logo certification requirements. A solution must be recertified when there has been a change to the hardware BoM.

To validate your solution, run the solution validation workflow twice. Run it once for the *minimally* supported configuration. Run it a second time for the *maximally* supported configuration. Microsoft validates the solution if both configurations pass all tests.

## Create a Solution Validation workflow

1. [!INCLUDE [azure-stack-vaas-workflow-step_select-solution](includes/azure-stack-vaas-workflow-step_select-solution.md)]

2. Select **Start** on the **Solution Validations** tile.

3. [!INCLUDE [azure-stack-vaas-workflow-step_naming](includes/azure-stack-vaas-workflow-step_naming.md)]

4. Select the **solution configuration**.
    - **Minimum**: the solution is configured with the minimum supported number of nodes.
    - **Maximum**: the solution is configured with the maximum supported number of nodes.

6. [!INCLUDE [azure-stack-vaas-workflow-step_test-params](includes/azure-stack-vaas-workflow-step_test-params.md)]

    > [!NOTE]
    > Environment parameters can't be modified after creating a workflow.

7. [!INCLUDE [azure-stack-vaas-workflow-step_tags](includes/azure-stack-vaas-workflow-step_tags.md)]
8. [!INCLUDE [azure-stack-vaas-workflow-step_submit](includes/azure-stack-vaas-workflow-step_submit.md)]
    You 'll be redirected to the tests summary page.

## Run Solution Validation tests

In the **Solution Validation tests summary** page, you'll see a list of the tests required for completing validation.

In the validation workflows, **scheduling** a test uses the workflow-level common parameters that you specified during workflow creation (see [Workflow common parameters for Azure Stack Hub validation as a service](azure-stack-vaas-parameters.md)). If any of the test parameter values become invalid, you must resupply them as instructed in [Modify workflow parameters](azure-stack-vaas-monitor-test.md#change-workflow-parameters).

> [!NOTE]
> Scheduling a validation test over an existing instance will create a new instance in place of the old instance in the portal. Logs for the old instance will be retained but aren't accessible from the portal.<br>
Once a test has completed successfully, the **Schedule** action becomes disabled.

1. [!INCLUDE [azure-stack-vaas-workflow-step_select-agent](includes/azure-stack-vaas-workflow-step_select-agent.md)]

2. Select the following tests:
    - Cloud Simulation Engine
    - Disk Identification Test

3. Select **Schedule** from the context menu to open a prompt for scheduling the test instance.

4. Review the test parameters and then select **Submit** to schedule the test for execution.
